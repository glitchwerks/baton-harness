"""Hook: before_run — sync the worktree branch onto the chain base.

Invoked by Baton once, before the first turn of each run.  First validates
the GitHub PAT via ``_auth.validate_github_token`` (defense-in-depth gate),
then fetches the latest ref and rebases the current worktree branch onto it
so the agent always operates on a fresh baseline.

The rebase target is controlled by the ``CHAIN_BASE_BRANCH`` environment
variable (default ``origin/main``).  The daemon threads this variable when
running per-issue branches inside a milestone work unit, so that the branch
rebases onto ``feature/<slug>`` rather than ``main``.  The ref is resolved
to a concrete SHA at entry (``git rev-parse <ref>``) to avoid moving-target
problems on ``--no-ff`` feature branches (B-I1, §3.7 of the chain spec).

On rebase conflict the hook calls ``git rebase --abort`` to restore the
worktree to a clean state before returning non-zero.  Baton sees the
non-zero exit and can surface the failure rather than leaving the
worktree in a mid-rebase limbo.

Entry point: ``bh-before-run`` (defined in ``pyproject.toml``).

WORKFLOW.md hook line (issue #5)::

    before_run: bh-before-run

Context:
    The hook runs with ``$PWD`` set to the worktree directory.  The issue
    number is inferred from ``basename($PWD)`` via
    ``baton_harness._cli.resolve_issue_number`` (spike finding F2).
    Baton names worktrees ``<repo>/.symphony/worktrees/<issue>`` (a bare
    integer); the harness's own convention is ``<repo>/.worktrees/<branch>``
    (``<prefix>-<issue>[-<slug>]``).  Both forms are accepted.

    All subprocess calls use ``encoding="utf-8"`` explicitly to avoid
    Windows cp1252 mangling of non-ASCII git output.

    """Entry point for the ``bh-before-run`` console script.

    Performs a branch sync in up to four steps:

    0. **Auth gate** — calls ``validate_github_token()`` to reject
       missing, classic, or otherwise non-fine-grained PATs before any
       git work begins.  On failure, logs a clear error and returns
       non-zero immediately without touching the worktree.
    1. ``git fetch origin main`` — brings the remote ref up to date.
       **Skipped** when ``CHAIN_BASE_BRANCH`` is set: the daemon has already
       prepared a concrete local cut-point (spec §3.7), so fetching
       ``main`` is both wrong (it is not the base) and unnecessary.
    2. ``git rev-parse <CHAIN_BASE_BRANCH>`` — resolves the base ref to a
       concrete SHA at entry.  This prevents moving-target problems on
       ``--no-ff`` feature branches (B-I1, chain spec §3.7).
       ``CHAIN_BASE_BRANCH`` defaults to ``origin/main`` when unset.
    3. ``git rebase <resolved-sha>`` — fast-forwards or replays the current
       branch on top of the frozen base SHA.

    If rebase succeeds (exit 0 — including the already-up-to-date case),
    the hook returns 0.  If rebase fails (conflict or other error),
    ``git rebase --abort`` is called to restore clean state, then the hook
    returns non-zero so Baton sees the failure.

    Args:
        argv: Unused; accepted for interface symmetry with other hooks.

    Returns:
        ``0`` on success; ``1`` when the issue number cannot be resolved,
        the auth gate fails, or the base ref cannot be resolved; non-zero
        when fetch or rebase fails.
